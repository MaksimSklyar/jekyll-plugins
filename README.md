# Jekyll Plugins 'n' Tools (Book Edition)


> **Note:** The book edition is still an early release and a work-in-progess.


This is the plugins and tools documentation (mostly READMEs)
for the Jekyll static site builder / generator
reformatted in a single-page book edition.

See the [source repo](https://github.com/planetjekyll/book-jekyll-plugins) for how
the book gets auto-built with "plain" Jekyll - of course - and
hosted on GitHub Pages.
